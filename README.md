# StupodStatsApi

Have you ever wanted to have an API for the most completely useless facts? Like how long i've been alive for, except in hundreths of a second. Or a randomly generated number, but it's a constant that I got from a random dice roll and I'm never going to change it (unless i feel like it).

*If so, then this is the API for you!*

--------------------------------------
This is a dumb project I started in Visual Studio MVC stuff and I had to add it to github to practice using git and github with visual studio.

Anyone can contribute if they want to try and add more dumb features to it. I don't really care what you add as long as it's not too useful. Because otherwise this API isn't pointless anymore.
